  "title": "",
  "content": "Nest applications handle requests and produce responses in a sequence we refer to as the request lifecycle. With the use of middleware, pipes, guards, and interceptors, it can be challenging to track down where a particular piece of code executes during the request lifecycle, especially as global, controller level, and route level components come into play. In general, a request flows through middleware to guards, then to interceptors, then to pipes and finally back to interceptors on the return path (as the response is generated).\n\nMiddleware is executed in a particular sequence. First, Nest runs globally bound middleware (such as middleware bound with app.use) and then it runs module bound middleware, which are determined on paths. Middleware are run sequentially in the order they are bound, similar to the way middleware in Express works. In the case of middleware bound across different modules, the middleware bound to the root module will run first, and then middleware will run in the order that the modules are added to the imports array.\n\nGuard execution starts with global guards, then proceeds to controller guards, and finally to route guards. As with middleware, guards run in the order in which they are bound. For example:\n\nGuard1 will execute before Guard2 and both will execute before Guard3.\n\nInterceptors, for the most part, follow the same pattern as guards, with one catch: as interceptors return RxJS Observables, the observables will be resolved in a first in last out manner. So inbound requests will go through the standard global, controller, route level resolution, but the response side of the request (i.e., after returning from the controller method handler) will be resolved from route to controller to global. Also, any errors thrown by pipes, controllers, or services can be read in the catchError operator of an interceptor.\n\nPipes follow the standard global to controller to route bound sequence, with the same first in first out in regards to the @UsePipes() parameters. However, at a route parameter level, if you have multiple pipes running, they will run in the order of the last parameter with a pipe to the first. This also applies to the route level and controller level pipes. For example, if we have the following controller:\n\nthen the GeneralValidationPipe will run for the query, then the params, and then the body objects before moving on to the RouteSpecificPipe, which follows the same order. If any parameter-specific pipes were in place, they would run (again, from the last to first parameter) after the controller and route level pipes.\n\nFilters are the only component that do not resolve global first. Instead, filters resolve from the lowest level possible, meaning execution starts with any route bound filters and proceeding next to controller level, and finally to global filters. Note that exceptions cannot be passed from filter to filter; if a route level filter catches the exception, a controller or global level filter cannot catch the same exception. The only way to achieve an effect like this is to use inheritance between the filters.\n\nIn general, the request lifecycle looks like the following:",
