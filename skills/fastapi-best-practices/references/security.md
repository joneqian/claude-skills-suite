    - A "professional" attack¶
    - Fix it with secrets.compare_digest()¶
  - Return the error¶

For the simplest cases, you can use HTTP Basic Auth.

In HTTP Basic Auth, the application expects a header that contains a username and a password.

If it doesn't receive it, it returns an HTTP 401 "Unauthorized" error.

And returns a header WWW-Authenticate with a value of Basic, and an optional realm parameter.

That tells the browser to show the integrated prompt for a username and password.

Then, when you type that username and password, the browser sends them in the header automatically.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

When you try to open the URL for the first time (or click the "Execute" button in the docs) the browser will ask you for your username and password:

Here's a more complete example.

Use a dependency to check if the username and password are correct.

For this, use the Python standard module secrets to check the username and password.

secrets.compare_digest() needs to take bytes or a str that only contains ASCII characters (the ones in English), this means it wouldn't work with characters like á, as in Sebastián.

To handle that, we first convert the username and password to bytes encoding them with UTF-8.

Then we can use secrets.compare_digest() to ensure that credentials.username is "stanleyjobson", and that credentials.password is "swordfish".

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

This would be similar to:

But by using the secrets.compare_digest() it will be secure against a type of attacks called "timing attacks".

But what's a "timing attack"?

Let's imagine some attackers are trying to guess the username and password.

And they send a request with a username johndoe and a password love123.

Then the Python code in your application would be equivalent to something like:

But right at the moment Python compares the first j in johndoe to the first s in stanleyjobson, it will return False, because it already knows that those two strings are not the same, thinking that "there's no need to waste more computation comparing the rest of the letters". And your application will say "Incorrect username or password".

But then the attackers try with username stanleyjobsox and password love123.

And your application code does something like:

Python will have to compare the whole stanleyjobso in both stanleyjobsox and stanleyjobson before realizing that both strings are not the same. So it will take some extra microseconds to reply back "Incorrect username or password".

At that point, by noticing that the server took some microseconds longer to send the "Incorrect username or password" response, the attackers will know that they got something right, some of the initial letters were right.

And then they can try again knowing that it's probably something more similar to stanleyjobsox than to johndoe.

Of course, the attackers would not try all this by hand, they would write a program to do it, possibly with thousands or millions of tests per second. And they would get just one extra correct letter at a time.

But doing that, in some minutes or hours the attackers would have guessed the correct username and password, with the "help" of our application, just using the time taken to answer.

But in our code we are actually using secrets.compare_digest().

In short, it will take the same time to compare stanleyjobsox to stanleyjobson than it takes to compare johndoe to stanleyjobson. And the same for the password.

That way, using secrets.compare_digest() in your application code, it will be safe against this whole range of security attacks.

After detecting that the credentials are incorrect, return an HTTPException with a status code 401 (the same returned when no credentials are provided) and add the header WWW-Authenticate to make the browser show the login prompt again:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python

app = FastAPI()

security = HTTPBasic()


@app.get("/users/me")
def read_current_user(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)):
    return {"username": credentials.username, "password": credentials.password}
```

    )
    current_password_bytes = credentials.password.encode("utf8")
    correct_password_bytes = b"swordfish"
    is_correct_password = secrets.compare_digest(
        current_password_bytes, correct_password_bytes
    )
    if not (is_correct_username and is_correct_password):
        raise HTTPException(

    return credentials.username


@app.get("/users/me")
def read_current_user(username: Annotated[str, Depends(get_current_username)]):
    return {"username": username}
```

Example 4 (python):
```python

When you need to declare dependencies with OAuth2 scopes you use Security().

But you still need to define what is the dependable, the callable that you pass as a parameter to Depends() or Security().

There are multiple tools that you can use to create those dependables, and they get integrated into OpenAPI so they are shown in the automatic docs UI, they can be used by automatically generated clients and SDKs, etc.

You can import them from fastapi.security:

API key authentication using a cookie.

This defines the name of the cookie that should be provided in the request with the API key and integrates that into the OpenAPI documentation. It extracts the key value sent in the cookie automatically and provides it as the dependency result. But it doesn't define how to set that cookie.

Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in Depends().

The dependency result will be a string containing the key value.

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if the cookie is not provided, APIKeyCookie will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the cookie is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, in a cookie or in an HTTP Bearer token).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

The WWW-Authenticate header is not standardized for API Key authentication but the HTTP specification requires that an error of 401 "Unauthorized" must include a WWW-Authenticate header.

Ref: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-401-unauthorized

For this, this method sends a custom challenge APIKey.

API key authentication using a header.

This defines the name of the header that should be provided in the request with the API key and integrates that into the OpenAPI documentation. It extracts the key value sent in the header automatically and provides it as the dependency result. But it doesn't define how to send that key to the client.

Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in Depends().

The dependency result will be a string containing the key value.

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if the header is not provided, APIKeyHeader will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the header is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, in a header or in an HTTP Bearer token).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

The WWW-Authenticate header is not standardized for API Key authentication but the HTTP specification requires that an error of 401 "Unauthorized" must include a WWW-Authenticate header.

Ref: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-401-unauthorized

For this, this method sends a custom challenge APIKey.

API key authentication using a query parameter.

This defines the name of the query parameter that should be provided in the request with the API key and integrates that into the OpenAPI documentation. It extracts the key value sent in the query parameter automatically and provides it as the dependency result. But it doesn't define how to send that API key to the client.

Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in Depends().

The dependency result will be a string containing the key value.

Query parameter name.

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if the query parameter is not provided, APIKeyQuery will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the query parameter is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, in a query parameter or in an HTTP Bearer token).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

The WWW-Authenticate header is not standardized for API Key authentication but the HTTP specification requires that an error of 401 "Unauthorized" must include a WWW-Authenticate header.

Ref: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-401-unauthorized

For this, this method sends a custom challenge APIKey.

HTTP Basic authentication.

Ref: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617

Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in Depends().

The dependency result will be an HTTPBasicCredentials object containing the username and the password.

Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for HTTP Basic Auth.

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

HTTP Basic authentication realm.

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if the HTTP Basic authentication is not provided (a header), HTTPBasic will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the HTTP Basic authentication is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, in HTTP Basic authentication or in an HTTP Bearer token).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

HTTP Bearer token authentication.

Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in Depends().

The dependency result will be an HTTPAuthorizationCredentials object containing the scheme and the credentials.

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if the HTTP Bearer token is not provided (in an Authorization header), HTTPBearer will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the HTTP Bearer token is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, in an HTTP Bearer token or in a cookie).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

HTTP Digest authentication.

Warning: this is only a stub to connect the components with OpenAPI in FastAPI, but it doesn't implement the full Digest scheme, you would need to to subclass it and implement it in your code.

Ref: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7616

Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in Depends().

The dependency result will be an HTTPAuthorizationCredentials object containing the scheme and the credentials.

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if the HTTP Digest is not provided, HTTPDigest will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the HTTP Digest is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, in HTTP Digest or in a cookie).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

The HTTP authorization credentials in the result of using HTTPBearer or HTTPDigest in a dependency.

The HTTP authorization header value is split by the first space.

The first part is the scheme, the second part is the credentials.

For example, in an HTTP Bearer token scheme, the client will send a header like:

The HTTP authorization scheme extracted from the header value.

The HTTP authorization credentials extracted from the header value.

The HTTP Basic credentials given as the result of using HTTPBasic in a dependency.

Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for HTTP Basic Auth.

The HTTP Basic username.

The HTTP Basic password.

This is the base class for OAuth2 authentication, an instance of it would be used as a dependency. All other OAuth2 classes inherit from it and customize it for each OAuth2 flow.

You normally would not create a new class inheriting from it but use one of the existing subclasses, and maybe compose them if you want to support multiple flows.

Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for Security.

The dictionary of OAuth2 flows.

TYPE: Union[OAuthFlows, dict[str, dict[str, Any]]] DEFAULT: OAuthFlows()

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if no HTTP Authorization header is provided, required for OAuth2 authentication, it will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the HTTP Authorization header is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, with OAuth2 or in a cookie).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

The OAuth 2 specification doesn't define the challenge that should be used, because a Bearer token is not really the only option to authenticate.

But declaring any other authentication challenge would be application-specific as it's not defined in the specification.

For practical reasons, this method uses the Bearer challenge by default, as it's probably the most common one.

If you are implementing an OAuth2 authentication scheme other than the provided ones in FastAPI (based on bearer tokens), you might want to override this.

Ref: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749

OAuth2 flow for authentication using a bearer token obtained with an OAuth2 code flow. An instance of it would be used as a dependency.

The URL to obtain the OAuth2 token.

The URL to refresh the token and obtain a new one.

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

The OAuth2 scopes that would be required by the path operations that use this dependency.

TYPE: Optional[dict[str, str]] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if no HTTP Authorization header is provided, required for OAuth2 authentication, it will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the HTTP Authorization header is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

The URL to obtain the OAuth2 token. This would be the path operation that has OAuth2PasswordRequestForm as a dependency.

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

The OAuth2 scopes that would be required by the path operations that use this dependency.

If you are implementing an OAuth2 authentication scheme other than the provided ones in FastAPI (based on bearer tokens), you might want to override this.

Ref: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749

This is a dependency class to collect the username and password as form data for an OAuth2 password flow.

The OAuth2 specification dictates that for a password flow the data should be collected using form data (instead of JSON) and that it should have the specific fields username and password.

All the initialization parameters are extracted from the request.

Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer.

Note that for OAuth2 the scope items:read is a single scope in an opaque string. You could have custom internal logic to separate it by colon characters (:) or similar, and get the two parts items and read. Many applications do that to group and organize permissions, you could do it as well in your application, just know that that it is application specific, it's not part of the specification.

The OAuth2 spec says it is required and MUST be the fixed string "password". Nevertheless, this dependency class is permissive and allows not passing it. If you want to enforce it, use instead the OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict dependency.

TYPE: Union[str, None] DEFAULT: None

username string. The OAuth2 spec requires the exact field name username.

password string. The OAuth2 spec requires the exact field name password.

A single string with actually several scopes separated by spaces. Each scope is also a string.

For example, a single string with:

```python "items:read items:write users:read profile openid" ````

would represent the scopes:

TYPE: str DEFAULT: ''

If there's a client_id, it can be sent as part of the form fields. But the OAuth2 specification recommends sending the client_id and client_secret (if any) using HTTP Basic auth.

TYPE: Union[str, None] DEFAULT: None

If there's a client_password (and a client_id), they can be sent as part of the form fields. But the OAuth2 specification recommends sending the client_id and client_secret (if any) using HTTP Basic auth.

TYPE: Union[str, None] DEFAULT: None

Bases: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm

This is a dependency class to collect the username and password as form data for an OAuth2 password flow.

The OAuth2 specification dictates that for a password flow the data should be collected using form data (instead of JSON) and that it should have the specific fields username and password.

All the initialization parameters are extracted from the request.

The only difference between OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict and OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is that OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict requires the client to send the form field grant_type with the value "password", which is required in the OAuth2 specification (it seems that for no particular reason), while for OAuth2PasswordRequestForm grant_type is optional.

Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer.

Note that for OAuth2 the scope items:read is a single scope in an opaque string. You could have custom internal logic to separate it by colon characters (:) or similar, and get the two parts items and read. Many applications do that to group and organize permissions, you could do it as well in your application, just know that that it is application specific, it's not part of the specification.

This dependency is strict about it. If you want to be permissive, use instead the OAuth2PasswordRequestForm dependency class.

username: username string. The OAuth2 spec requires the exact field name "username". password: password string. The OAuth2 spec requires the exact field name "password". scope: Optional string. Several scopes (each one a string) separated by spaces. E.g. "items:read items:write users:read profile openid" client_id: optional string. OAuth2 recommends sending the client_id and client_secret (if any) using HTTP Basic auth, as: client_id:client_secret client_secret: optional string. OAuth2 recommends sending the client_id and client_secret (if any) using HTTP Basic auth, as: client_id:client_secret

The OAuth2 spec says it is required and MUST be the fixed string "password". This dependency is strict about it. If you want to be permissive, use instead the OAuth2PasswordRequestForm dependency class.

username string. The OAuth2 spec requires the exact field name username.

password string. The OAuth2 spec requires the exact field name password.

A single string with actually several scopes separated by spaces. Each scope is also a string.

For example, a single string with:

```python "items:read items:write users:read profile openid" ````

would represent the scopes:

TYPE: str DEFAULT: ''

If there's a client_id, it can be sent as part of the form fields. But the OAuth2 specification recommends sending the client_id and client_secret (if any) using HTTP Basic auth.

TYPE: Union[str, None] DEFAULT: None

If there's a client_password (and a client_id), they can be sent as part of the form fields. But the OAuth2 specification recommends sending the client_id and client_secret (if any) using HTTP Basic auth.

TYPE: Union[str, None] DEFAULT: None

This is a special class that you can define in a parameter in a dependency to obtain the OAuth2 scopes required by all the dependencies in the same chain.

This way, multiple dependencies can have different scopes, even when used in the same path operation. And with this, you can access all the scopes required in all those dependencies in a single place.

Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for OAuth2 scopes.

This will be filled by FastAPI.

TYPE: Optional[list[str]] DEFAULT: None

The list of all the scopes required by dependencies.

All the scopes required by all the dependencies in a single string separated by spaces, as defined in the OAuth2 specification.

OpenID Connect authentication class. An instance of it would be used as a dependency.

Warning: this is only a stub to connect the components with OpenAPI in FastAPI, but it doesn't implement the full OpenIdConnect scheme, for example, it doesn't use the OpenIDConnect URL. You would need to to subclass it and implement it in your code.

The OpenID Connect URL.

Security scheme name.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

Security scheme description.

It will be included in the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at /docs).

TYPE: Optional[str] DEFAULT: None

By default, if no HTTP Authorization header is provided, required for OpenID Connect authentication, it will automatically cancel the request and send the client an error.

If auto_error is set to False, when the HTTP Authorization header is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will be None.

This is useful when you want to have optional authentication.

It is also useful when you want to have authentication that can be provided in one of multiple optional ways (for example, with OpenID Connect or in a cookie).

TYPE: bool DEFAULT: True

    OAuth2PasswordBearer,
    OAuth2PasswordRequestForm,
    OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict,

## Get Current User¶

**Contents:**

- Get the user¶

- Recap¶

In the previous chapter the security system (which is based on the dependency injection system) was giving the path operation function a token as a str:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

But that is still not that useful.

Let's make it give us the current user.

First, let's create a Pydantic user model.

The same way we use Pydantic to declare bodies, we can use it anywhere else:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Let's create a dependency get_current_user.

Remember that dependencies can have sub-dependencies?

get_current_user will have a dependency with the same oauth2_scheme we created before.

The same as we were doing before in the path operation directly, our new dependency get_current_user will receive a token as a str from the sub-dependency oauth2_scheme:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

get_current_user will use a (fake) utility function we created, that takes a token as a str and returns our Pydantic User model:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

So now we can use the same Depends with our get_current_user in the path operation:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Notice that we declare the type of current_user as the Pydantic model User.

This will help us inside of the function with all the completion and type checks.

You might remember that request bodies are also declared with Pydantic models.

Here FastAPI won't get confused because you are using Depends.

The way this dependency system is designed allows us to have different dependencies (different "dependables") that all return a User model.

We are not restricted to having only one dependency that can return that type of data.

You can now get the current user directly in the path operation functions and deal with the security mechanisms at the Dependency Injection level, using Depends.

And you can use any model or data for the security requirements (in this case, a Pydantic model User).

But you are not restricted to using some specific data model, class or type.

Do you want to have an id and email and not have any username in your model? Sure. You can use these same tools.

Do you want to just have a str? Or just a dict? Or a database class model instance directly? It all works the same way.

You actually don't have users that log in to your application but robots, bots, or other systems, that have just an access token? Again, it all works the same.

Just use any kind of model, any kind of class, any kind of database that you need for your application. FastAPI has you covered with the dependency injection system.

This example might seem verbose. Keep in mind that we are mixing security, data models, utility functions and path operations in the same file.

But here's the key point.

The security and dependency injection stuff is written once.

And you can make it as complex as you want. And still, have it written only once, in a single place. With all the flexibility.

But you can have thousands of endpoints (path operations) using the same security system.

And all of them (or any portion of them that you want) can take advantage of re-using these dependencies or any other dependencies you create.

And all these thousands of path operations can be as small as 3 lines:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

You can now get the current user directly in your path operation function.

We are already halfway there.

We just need to add a path operation for the user/client to actually send the username and password.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    return {"token": token}
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    return {"token": token}
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str | None = None
    full_name: str | None = None
    disabled: bool | None = None


def fake_decode_token(token):
    return User(
        username=token + "fakedecoded", email="john@example.com", full_name="John Doe"
    )


async def get_current_user(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    user = fake_decode_token(token)
    return user


@app.get("/users/me")
async def read_users_me(current_user: Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]):
    return current_user
```

Example 4 (python):
```python
from typing import Annotated, Union

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: Union[str, None] = None
    full_name: Union[str, None] = None
    disabled: Union[bool, None] = None


def fake_decode_token(token):
    return User(
        username=token + "fakedecoded", email="john@example.com", full_name="John Doe"
    )


async def get_current_user(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    user = fake_decode_token(token)
    return user

## Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer¶

**URL:** https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/

**Contents:**
- Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer¶
- Get the username and password¶
  - scope¶
- Code to get the username and password¶
  - OAuth2PasswordRequestForm¶
  - Use the form data¶
  - Check the password¶
    - Password hashing¶
      - Why use password hashing¶
    - About **user_dict¶

Now let's build from the previous chapter and add the missing parts to have a complete security flow.

We are going to use FastAPI security utilities to get the username and password.

OAuth2 specifies that when using the "password flow" (that we are using) the client/user must send a username and password fields as form data.

And the spec says that the fields have to be named like that. So user-name or email wouldn't work.

But don't worry, you can show it as you wish to your final users in the frontend.

And your database models can use any other names you want.

But for the login path operation, we need to use these names to be compatible with the spec (and be able to, for example, use the integrated API documentation system).

The spec also states that the username and password must be sent as form data (so, no JSON here).

The spec also says that the client can send another form field "scope".

The form field name is scope (in singular), but it is actually a long string with "scopes" separated by spaces.

Each "scope" is just a string (without spaces).

They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example:

In OAuth2 a "scope" is just a string that declares a specific permission required.

It doesn't matter if it has other characters like : or if it is a URL.

Those details are implementation specific.

For OAuth2 they are just strings.

Now let's use the utilities provided by FastAPI to handle this.

First, import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, and use it as a dependency with Depends in the path operation for /token:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is a class dependency that declares a form body with:

The OAuth2 spec actually requires a field grant_type with a fixed value of password, but OAuth2PasswordRequestForm doesn't enforce it.

If you need to enforce it, use OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict instead of OAuth2PasswordRequestForm.

The OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is not a special class for FastAPI as is OAuth2PasswordBearer.

OAuth2PasswordBearer makes FastAPI know that it is a security scheme. So it is added that way to OpenAPI.

But OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is just a class dependency that you could have written yourself, or you could have declared Form parameters directly.

But as it's a common use case, it is provided by FastAPI directly, just to make it easier.

The instance of the dependency class OAuth2PasswordRequestForm won't have an attribute scope with the long string separated by spaces, instead, it will have a scopes attribute with the actual list of strings for each scope sent.

We are not using scopes in this example, but the functionality is there if you need it.

Now, get the user data from the (fake) database, using the username from the form field.

If there is no such user, we return an error saying "Incorrect username or password".

For the error, we use the exception HTTPException:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

At this point we have the user data from our database, but we haven't checked the password.

Let's put that data in the Pydantic UserInDB model first.

You should never save plaintext passwords, so, we'll use the (fake) password hashing system.

If the passwords don't match, we return the same error.

"Hashing" means: converting some content (a password in this case) into a sequence of bytes (just a string) that looks like gibberish.

Whenever you pass exactly the same content (exactly the same password) you get exactly the same gibberish.

But you cannot convert from the gibberish back to the password.

If your database is stolen, the thief won't have your users' plaintext passwords, only the hashes.

So, the thief won't be able to try to use those same passwords in another system (as many users use the same password everywhere, this would be dangerous).

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

UserInDB(**user_dict) means:

Pass the keys and values of the user_dict directly as key-value arguments, equivalent to:

For a more complete explanation of **user_dict check back in the documentation for Extra Models.

The response of the token endpoint must be a JSON object.

It should have a token_type. In our case, as we are using "Bearer" tokens, the token type should be "bearer".

And it should have an access_token, with a string containing our access token.

For this simple example, we are going to just be completely insecure and return the same username as the token.

In the next chapter, you will see a real secure implementation, with password hashing and JWT tokens.

But for now, let's focus on the specific details we need.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

By the spec, you should return a JSON with an access_token and a token_type, the same as in this example.

This is something that you have to do yourself in your code, and make sure you use those JSON keys.

It's almost the only thing that you have to remember to do correctly yourself, to be compliant with the specifications.

For the rest, FastAPI handles it for you.

Now we are going to update our dependencies.

We want to get the current_user only if this user is active.

So, we create an additional dependency get_current_active_user that in turn uses get_current_user as a dependency.

Both of these dependencies will just return an HTTP error if the user doesn't exist, or if is inactive.

So, in our endpoint, we will only get a user if the user exists, was correctly authenticated, and is active:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

The additional header WWW-Authenticate with value Bearer we are returning here is also part of the spec.

Any HTTP (error) status code 401 "UNAUTHORIZED" is supposed to also return a WWW-Authenticate header.

In the case of bearer tokens (our case), the value of that header should be Bearer.

You can actually skip that extra header and it would still work.

But it's provided here to be compliant with the specifications.

Also, there might be tools that expect and use it (now or in the future) and that might be useful for you or your users, now or in the future.

That's the benefit of standards...

Open the interactive docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Click the "Authorize" button.

After authenticating in the system, you will see it like:

Now use the operation GET with the path /users/me.

You will get your user's data, like:

If you click the lock icon and logout, and then try the same operation again, you will get an HTTP 401 error of:

Now try with an inactive user, authenticate with:

And try to use the operation GET with the path /users/me.

You will get an "Inactive user" error, like:

You now have the tools to implement a complete security system based on username and password for your API.

Using these tools, you can make the security system compatible with any database and with any user or data model.

The only detail missing is that it is not actually "secure" yet.

In the next chapter you'll see how to use a secure password hashing library and JWT tokens.

## Security¶

- Security¶

- OAuth2¶
  - OAuth 1¶

  - OpenID (not "OpenID Connect")¶
- OpenAPI¶
- FastAPI utilities¶

There are many ways to handle security, authentication and authorization.

And it normally is a complex and "difficult" topic.

In many frameworks and systems just handling security and authentication takes a big amount of effort and code (in many cases it can be 50% or more of all the code written).

FastAPI provides several tools to help you deal with Security easily, rapidly, in a standard way, without having to study and learn all the security specifications.

But first, let's check some small concepts.

If you don't care about any of these terms and you just need to add security with authentication based on username and password right now, skip to the next chapters.

OAuth2 is a specification that defines several ways to handle authentication and authorization.

It is quite an extensive specification and covers several complex use cases.

It includes ways to authenticate using a "third party".

That's what all the systems with "login with Facebook, Google, X (Twitter), GitHub" use underneath.

There was an OAuth 1, which is very different from OAuth2, and more complex, as it included direct specifications on how to encrypt the communication.

It is not very popular or used nowadays.

OAuth2 doesn't specify how to encrypt the communication, it expects you to have your application served with HTTPS.

In the section about deployment you will see how to set up HTTPS for free, using Traefik and Let's Encrypt.

OpenID Connect is another specification, based on OAuth2.

It just extends OAuth2 specifying some things that are relatively ambiguous in OAuth2, to try to make it more interoperable.

For example, Google login uses OpenID Connect (which underneath uses OAuth2).

But Facebook login doesn't support OpenID Connect. It has its own flavor of OAuth2.

There was also an "OpenID" specification. That tried to solve the same thing as OpenID Connect, but was not based on OAuth2.

So, it was a complete additional system.

It is not very popular or used nowadays.

OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) is the open specification for building APIs (now part of the Linux Foundation).

FastAPI is based on OpenAPI.

That's what makes it possible to have multiple automatic interactive documentation interfaces, code generation, etc.

OpenAPI has a way to define multiple security "schemes".

By using them, you can take advantage of all these standard-based tools, including these interactive documentation systems.

OpenAPI defines the following security schemes:

Integrating other authentication/authorization providers like Google, Facebook, X (Twitter), GitHub, etc. is also possible and relatively easy.

The most complex problem is building an authentication/authorization provider like those, but FastAPI gives you the tools to do it easily, while doing the heavy lifting for you.

FastAPI provides several tools for each of these security schemes in the fastapi.security module that simplify using these security mechanisms.

In the next chapters you will see how to add security to your API using those tools provided by FastAPI.

And you will also see how it gets automatically integrated into the interactive documentation system.

## OAuth2 scopes¶

**URL:** https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/

**Contents:**
- OAuth2 scopes¶
- OAuth2 scopes and OpenAPI¶
- Global view¶
- OAuth2 Security scheme¶
- JWT token with scopes¶
- Declare scopes in path operations and dependencies¶
- Use SecurityScopes¶
- Use the scopes¶
- Verify the username and data shape¶
- Verify the scopes¶

You can use OAuth2 scopes directly with FastAPI, they are integrated to work seamlessly.

This would allow you to have a more fine-grained permission system, following the OAuth2 standard, integrated into your OpenAPI application (and the API docs).

OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, X (Twitter), etc. They use it to provide specific permissions to users and applications.

Every time you "log in with" Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, X (Twitter), that application is using OAuth2 with scopes.

In this section you will see how to manage authentication and authorization with the same OAuth2 with scopes in your FastAPI application.

This is a more or less advanced section. If you are just starting, you can skip it.

You don't necessarily need OAuth2 scopes, and you can handle authentication and authorization however you want.

But OAuth2 with scopes can be nicely integrated into your API (with OpenAPI) and your API docs.

Nevertheless, you still enforce those scopes, or any other security/authorization requirement, however you need, in your code.

In many cases, OAuth2 with scopes can be an overkill.

But if you know you need it, or you are curious, keep reading.

The OAuth2 specification defines "scopes" as a list of strings separated by spaces.

The content of each of these strings can have any format, but should not contain spaces.

These scopes represent "permissions".

In OpenAPI (e.g. the API docs), you can define "security schemes".

When one of these security schemes uses OAuth2, you can also declare and use scopes.

Each "scope" is just a string (without spaces).

They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example:

In OAuth2 a "scope" is just a string that declares a specific permission required.

It doesn't matter if it has other characters like : or if it is a URL.

Those details are implementation specific.

For OAuth2 they are just strings.

First, let's quickly see the parts that change from the examples in the main Tutorial - User Guide for OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens. Now using OAuth2 scopes:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Now let's review those changes step by step.

The first change is that now we are declaring the OAuth2 security scheme with two available scopes, me and items.

The scopes parameter receives a dict with each scope as a key and the description as the value:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Because we are now declaring those scopes, they will show up in the API docs when you log-in/authorize.

And you will be able to select which scopes you want to give access to: me and items.

This is the same mechanism used when you give permissions while logging in with Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc:

Now, modify the token path operation to return the scopes requested.

We are still using the same OAuth2PasswordRequestForm. It includes a property scopes with a list of str, with each scope it received in the request.

And we return the scopes as part of the JWT token.

For simplicity, here we are just adding the scopes received directly to the token.

But in your application, for security, you should make sure you only add the scopes that the user is actually able to have, or the ones you have predefined.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Now we declare that the path operation for /users/me/items/ requires the scope items.

For this, we import and use Security from fastapi.

You can use Security to declare dependencies (just like Depends), but Security also receives a parameter scopes with a list of scopes (strings).

In this case, we pass a dependency function get_current_active_user to Security (the same way we would do with Depends).

But we also pass a list of scopes, in this case with just one scope: items (it could have more).

And the dependency function get_current_active_user can also declare sub-dependencies, not only with Depends but also with Security. Declaring its own sub-dependency function (get_current_user), and more scope requirements.

In this case, it requires the scope me (it could require more than one scope).

You don't necessarily need to add different scopes in different places.

We are doing it here to demonstrate how FastAPI handles scopes declared at different levels.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Security is actually a subclass of Depends, and it has just one extra parameter that we'll see later.

But by using Security instead of Depends, FastAPI will know that it can declare security scopes, use them internally, and document the API with OpenAPI.

But when you import Query, Path, Depends, Security and others from fastapi, those are actually functions that return special classes.

Now update the dependency get_current_user.

This is the one used by the dependencies above.

Here's where we are using the same OAuth2 scheme we created before, declaring it as a dependency: oauth2_scheme.

Because this dependency function doesn't have any scope requirements itself, we can use Depends with oauth2_scheme, we don't have to use Security when we don't need to specify security scopes.

We also declare a special parameter of type SecurityScopes, imported from fastapi.security.

This SecurityScopes class is similar to Request (Request was used to get the request object directly).

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

The parameter security_scopes will be of type SecurityScopes.

It will have a property scopes with a list containing all the scopes required by itself and all the dependencies that use this as a sub-dependency. That means, all the "dependants"... this might sound confusing, it is explained again later below.

The security_scopes object (of class SecurityScopes) also provides a scope_str attribute with a single string, containing those scopes separated by spaces (we are going to use it).

We create an HTTPException that we can reuse (raise) later at several points.

In this exception, we include the scopes required (if any) as a string separated by spaces (using scope_str). We put that string containing the scopes in the WWW-Authenticate header (this is part of the spec).

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

We verify that we get a username, and extract the scopes.

And then we validate that data with the Pydantic model (catching the ValidationError exception), and if we get an error reading the JWT token or validating the data with Pydantic, we raise the HTTPException we created before.

For that, we update the Pydantic model TokenData with a new property scopes.

By validating the data with Pydantic we can make sure that we have, for example, exactly a list of str with the scopes and a str with the username.

Instead of, for example, a dict, or something else, as it could break the application at some point later, making it a security risk.

We also verify that we have a user with that username, and if not, we raise that same exception we created before.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

We now verify that all the scopes required, by this dependency and all the dependants (including path operations), are included in the scopes provided in the token received, otherwise raise an HTTPException.

For this, we use security_scopes.scopes, that contains a list with all these scopes as str.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Let's review again this dependency tree and the scopes.

As the get_current_active_user dependency has as a sub-dependency on get_current_user, the scope "me" declared at get_current_active_user will be included in the list of required scopes in the security_scopes.scopes passed to get_current_user.

The path operation itself also declares a scope, "items", so this will also be in the list of security_scopes.scopes passed to get_current_user.

Here's how the hierarchy of dependencies and scopes looks like:

The important and "magic" thing here is that get_current_user will have a different list of scopes to check for each path operation.

All depending on the scopes declared in each path operation and each dependency in the dependency tree for that specific path operation.

You can use SecurityScopes at any point, and in multiple places, it doesn't have to be at the "root" dependency.

It will always have the security scopes declared in the current Security dependencies and all the dependants for that specific path operation and that specific dependency tree.

Because the SecurityScopes will have all the scopes declared by dependants, you can use it to verify that a token has the required scopes in a central dependency function, and then declare different scope requirements in different path operations.

They will be checked independently for each path operation.

If you open the API docs, you can authenticate and specify which scopes you want to authorize.

If you don't select any scope, you will be "authenticated", but when you try to access /users/me/ or /users/me/items/ you will get an error saying that you don't have enough permissions. You will still be able to access /status/.

And if you select the scope me but not the scope items, you will be able to access /users/me/ but not /users/me/items/.

That's what would happen to a third party application that tried to access one of these path operations with a token provided by a user, depending on how many permissions the user gave the application.

In this example we are using the OAuth2 "password" flow.

This is appropriate when we are logging in to our own application, probably with our own frontend.

Because we can trust it to receive the username and password, as we control it.

But if you are building an OAuth2 application that others would connect to (i.e., if you are building an authentication provider equivalent to Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc.) you should use one of the other flows.

The most common is the implicit flow.

The most secure is the code flow, but it's more complex to implement as it requires more steps. As it is more complex, many providers end up suggesting the implicit flow.

It's common that each authentication provider names their flows in a different way, to make it part of their brand.

But in the end, they are implementing the same OAuth2 standard.

FastAPI includes utilities for all these OAuth2 authentication flows in fastapi.security.oauth2.

The same way you can define a list of Depends in the decorator's dependencies parameter (as explained in Dependencies in path operation decorators), you could also use Security with scopes there.

## OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens¶

**URL:** https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/

**Contents:**
- OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens¶
- About JWT¶
- Install PyJWT¶
- Password hashing¶
  - Why use password hashing¶
- Install pwdlib¶
- Hash and verify the passwords¶
- Handle JWT tokens¶
- Update the dependencies¶
- Update the /token path operation¶

Now that we have all the security flow, let's make the application actually secure, using JWT tokens and secure password hashing.

This code is something you can actually use in your application, save the password hashes in your database, etc.

We are going to start from where we left in the previous chapter and increment it.

JWT means "JSON Web Tokens".

It's a standard to codify a JSON object in a long dense string without spaces. It looks like this:

It is not encrypted, so, anyone could recover the information from the contents.

But it's signed. So, when you receive a token that you emitted, you can verify that you actually emitted it.

That way, you can create a token with an expiration of, let's say, 1 week. And then when the user comes back the next day with the token, you know that user is still logged in to your system.

After a week, the token will be expired and the user will not be authorized and will have to sign in again to get a new token. And if the user (or a third party) tried to modify the token to change the expiration, you would be able to discover it, because the signatures would not match.

If you want to play with JWT tokens and see how they work, check https://jwt.io.

We need to install PyJWT to generate and verify the JWT tokens in Python.

Make sure you create a virtual environment, activate it, and then install pyjwt:

If you are planning to use digital signature algorithms like RSA or ECDSA, you should install the cryptography library dependency pyjwt[crypto].

You can read more about it in the PyJWT Installation docs.

"Hashing" means converting some content (a password in this case) into a sequence of bytes (just a string) that looks like gibberish.

Whenever you pass exactly the same content (exactly the same password) you get exactly the same gibberish.

But you cannot convert from the gibberish back to the password.

If your database is stolen, the thief won't have your users' plaintext passwords, only the hashes.

So, the thief won't be able to try to use that password in another system (as many users use the same password everywhere, this would be dangerous).

pwdlib is a great Python package to handle password hashes.

It supports many secure hashing algorithms and utilities to work with them.

The recommended algorithm is "Argon2".

Make sure you create a virtual environment, activate it, and then install pwdlib with Argon2:

With pwdlib, you could even configure it to be able to read passwords created by Django, a Flask security plug-in or many others.

So, you would be able to, for example, share the same data from a Django application in a database with a FastAPI application. Or gradually migrate a Django application using the same database.

And your users would be able to login from your Django app or from your FastAPI app, at the same time.

Import the tools we need from pwdlib.

Create a PasswordHash instance with recommended settings - it will be used for hashing and verifying passwords.

pwdlib also supports the bcrypt hashing algorithm but does not include legacy algorithms - for working with outdated hashes, it is recommended to use the passlib library.

For example, you could use it to read and verify passwords generated by another system (like Django) but hash any new passwords with a different algorithm like Argon2 or Bcrypt.

And be compatible with all of them at the same time.

Create a utility function to hash a password coming from the user.

And another utility to verify if a received password matches the hash stored.

And another one to authenticate and return a user.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

If you check the new (fake) database fake_users_db, you will see how the hashed password looks like now: "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$wagCPXjifgvUFBzq4hqe3w$CYaIb8sB+wtD+Vu/P4uod1+Qof8h+1g7bbDlBID48Rc".

Import the modules installed.

Create a random secret key that will be used to sign the JWT tokens.

To generate a secure random secret key use the command:

And copy the output to the variable SECRET_KEY (don't use the one in the example).

Create a variable ALGORITHM with the algorithm used to sign the JWT token and set it to "HS256".

Create a variable for the expiration of the token.

Define a Pydantic Model that will be used in the token endpoint for the response.

Create a utility function to generate a new access token.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Update get_current_user to receive the same token as before, but this time, using JWT tokens.

Decode the received token, verify it, and return the current user.

If the token is invalid, return an HTTP error right away.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Create a timedelta with the expiration time of the token.

Create a real JWT access token and return it.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

The JWT specification says that there's a key sub, with the subject of the token.

It's optional to use it, but that's where you would put the user's identification, so we are using it here.

JWT might be used for other things apart from identifying a user and allowing them to perform operations directly on your API.

For example, you could identify a "car" or a "blog post".

Then you could add permissions about that entity, like "drive" (for the car) or "edit" (for the blog).

And then, you could give that JWT token to a user (or bot), and they could use it to perform those actions (drive the car, or edit the blog post) without even needing to have an account, just with the JWT token your API generated for that.

Using these ideas, JWT can be used for way more sophisticated scenarios.

In those cases, several of those entities could have the same ID, let's say foo (a user foo, a car foo, and a blog post foo).

So, to avoid ID collisions, when creating the JWT token for the user, you could prefix the value of the sub key, e.g. with username:. So, in this example, the value of sub could have been: username:johndoe.

The important thing to keep in mind is that the sub key should have a unique identifier across the entire application, and it should be a string.

Run the server and go to the docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

You'll see the user interface like:

Authorize the application the same way as before.

Using the credentials:

Username: johndoe Password: secret

Notice that nowhere in the code is the plaintext password "secret", we only have the hashed version.

Call the endpoint /users/me/, you will get the response as:

If you open the developer tools, you could see how the data sent only includes the token, the password is only sent in the first request to authenticate the user and get that access token, but not afterwards:

Notice the header Authorization, with a value that starts with Bearer.

OAuth2 has the notion of "scopes".

You can use them to add a specific set of permissions to a JWT token.

Then you can give this token to a user directly or a third party, to interact with your API with a set of restrictions.

You can learn how to use them and how they are integrated into FastAPI later in the Advanced User Guide.

With what you have seen up to now, you can set up a secure FastAPI application using standards like OAuth2 and JWT.

In almost any framework handling the security becomes a rather complex subject quite quickly.

Many packages that simplify it a lot have to make many compromises with the data model, database, and available features. And some of these packages that simplify things too much actually have security flaws underneath.

FastAPI doesn't make any compromise with any database, data model or tool.

It gives you all the flexibility to choose the ones that fit your project the best.

And you can use directly many well maintained and widely used packages like pwdlib and PyJWT, because FastAPI doesn't require any complex mechanisms to integrate external packages.

But it provides you the tools to simplify the process as much as possible without compromising flexibility, robustness, or security.

And you can use and implement secure, standard protocols, like OAuth2 in a relatively simple way.

You can learn more in the Advanced User Guide about how to use OAuth2 "scopes", for a more fine-grained permission system, following these same standards. OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, X (Twitter), etc. to authorize third party applications to interact with their APIs on behalf of their users.
