  "title": "Response Status Code¶",
  "content": "The same way you can specify a response model, you can also declare the HTTP status code used for the response with the parameter status_code in any of the path operations:\n\nNotice that status_code is a parameter of the \"decorator\" method (get, post, etc). Not of your path operation function, like all the parameters and body.\n\nThe status_code parameter receives a number with the HTTP status code.\n\nstatus_code can alternatively also receive an IntEnum, such as Python's http.HTTPStatus.\n\nSome response codes (see the next section) indicate that the response does not have a body.\n\nFastAPI knows this, and will produce OpenAPI docs that state there is no response body.\n\nIf you already know what HTTP status codes are, skip to the next section.\n\nIn HTTP, you send a numeric status code of 3 digits as part of the response.\n\nThese status codes have a name associated to recognize them, but the important part is the number.\n\nTo know more about each status code and which code is for what, check the MDN documentation about HTTP status codes.\n\nLet's see the previous example again:\n\n201 is the status code for \"Created\".\n\nBut you don't have to memorize what each of these codes mean.\n\nYou can use the convenience variables from fastapi.status.\n\nThey are just a convenience, they hold the same number, but that way you can use the editor's autocomplete to find them:\n\nYou could also use from starlette import status.\n\nFastAPI provides the same starlette.status as fastapi.status just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.\n\nLater, in the Advanced User Guide, you will see how to return a different status code than the default you are declaring here.",
