  "content": "Expanding on the standalone application docs there's also the nest-commander package for writing command line applications in a structure similar to your typical Nest application.\n\nJust like any other package, you've got to install it before you can use it.\n\nnest-commander makes it easy to write new command-line applications with decorators via the @Command() decorator for classes and the @Option() decorator for methods of that class. Every command file should implement the CommandRunner abstract class and should be decorated with a @Command() decorator.\n\nEvery command is seen as an @Injectable() by Nest, so your normal Dependency Injection still works as you would expect it to. The only thing to take note of is the abstract class CommandRunner, which should be implemented by each command. The CommandRunner abstract class ensures that all commands have a run method that returns a Promise<void> and takes in the parameters string[], Record<string, any>. The run command is where you can kick all of your logic off from, it will take in whatever parameters did not match option flags and pass them in as an array, just in case you are really meaning to work with multiple parameters. As for the options, the Record<string, any>, the names of these properties match the name property given to the @Option() decorators, while their value matches the return of the option handler. If you'd like better type safety, you are welcome to create an interface for your options as well.\n\nSimilar to how in a NestJS application we can use the NestFactory to create a server for us, and run it using listen, the nest-commander package exposes a simple to use API to run your server. Import the CommandFactory and use the static method run and pass in the root module of your application. This would probably look like below\n\nBy default, Nest's logger is disabled when using the CommandFactory. It's possible to provide it though, as the second argument to the run function. You can either provide a custom NestJS logger, or an array of log levels you want to keep - it might be useful to at least provide ['error'] here, if you only want to print out Nest's error logs.\n\nAnd that's it. Under the hood, CommandFactory will worry about calling NestFactory for you and calling app.close() when necessary, so you shouldn't need to worry about memory leaks there. If you need to add in some error handling, there's always try/catch wrapping the run command, or you can chain on some .catch() method to the bootstrap() call.\n\nSo what's the use of writing a super awesome command line script if you can't test it super easily, right? Fortunately, nest-commander has some utilities you can make use of that fits in perfectly with the NestJS ecosystem, it'll feel right at home to any Nestlings out there. Instead of using the CommandFactory for building the command in test mode, you can use CommandTestFactory and pass in your metadata, very similarly to how Test.createTestingModule from @nestjs/testing works. In fact, it uses this package under the hood. You're also still able to chain on the overrideProvider methods before calling compile() so you can swap out DI pieces right in the test.\n\nThe following class would equate to having a CLI command that can take in the subcommand basic or be called directly, with -n, -s, and -b (along with their long flags) all being supported and with custom parsers for each option. The --help flag is also supported, as is customary with commander.\n\nMake sure the command class is added to a module\n\nAnd now to be able to run the CLI in your main.ts you can do the following\n\nAnd just like that, you've got a command line application.\n\nVisit the nest-commander docs site for more information, examples, and API documentation.",
