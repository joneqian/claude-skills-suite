  "content": "If you need to have two independent FastAPI applications, with their own independent OpenAPI and their own docs UIs, you can have a main app and \"mount\" one (or more) sub-application(s).\n\n\"Mounting\" means adding a completely \"independent\" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling everything under that path, with the path operations declared in that sub-application.\n\nFirst, create the main, top-level, FastAPI application, and its path operations:\n\nThen, create your sub-application, and its path operations.\n\nThis sub-application is just another standard FastAPI application, but this is the one that will be \"mounted\":\n\nIn your top-level application, app, mount the sub-application, subapi.\n\nIn this case, it will be mounted at the path /subapi:\n\nNow, run the fastapi command with your file:\n\nAnd open the docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.\n\nYou will see the automatic API docs for the main app, including only its own path operations:\n\nAnd then, open the docs for the sub-application, at http://127.0.0.1:8000/subapi/docs.\n\nYou will see the automatic API docs for the sub-application, including only its own path operations, all under the correct sub-path prefix /subapi:\n\nIf you try interacting with any of the two user interfaces, they will work correctly, because the browser will be able to talk to each specific app or sub-app.\n\nWhen you mount a sub-application as described above, FastAPI will take care of communicating the mount path for the sub-application using a mechanism from the ASGI specification called a root_path.\n\nThat way, the sub-application will know to use that path prefix for the docs UI.\n\nAnd the sub-application could also have its own mounted sub-applications and everything would work correctly, because FastAPI handles all these root_paths automatically.\n\nYou will learn more about the root_path and how to use it explicitly in the section about Behind a Proxy.",
