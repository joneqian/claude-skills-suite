  "content": "If you needed to, you could use settings and environment variables to configure OpenAPI conditionally depending on the environment, and even disable it entirely.\n\nHiding your documentation user interfaces in production shouldn't be the way to protect your API.\n\nThat doesn't add any extra security to your API, the path operations will still be available where they are.\n\nIf there's a security flaw in your code, it will still exist.\n\nHiding the documentation just makes it more difficult to understand how to interact with your API, and could make it more difficult for you to debug it in production. It could be considered simply a form of Security through obscurity.\n\nIf you want to secure your API, there are several better things you can do, for example:\n\nNevertheless, you might have a very specific use case where you really need to disable the API docs for some environment (e.g. for production) or depending on configurations from environment variables.\n\nYou can easily use the same Pydantic settings to configure your generated OpenAPI and the docs UIs.\n\nHere we declare the setting openapi_url with the same default of \"/openapi.json\".\n\nAnd then we use it when creating the FastAPI app.\n\nThen you could disable OpenAPI (including the UI docs) by setting the environment variable OPENAPI_URL to the empty string, like:\n\nThen if you go to the URLs at /openapi.json, /docs, or /redoc you will just get a 404 Not Found error like:",
