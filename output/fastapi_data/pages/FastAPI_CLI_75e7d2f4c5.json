  "content": "FastAPI CLI is a command line program that you can use to serve your FastAPI app, manage your FastAPI project, and more.\n\nWhen you install FastAPI (e.g. with pip install \"fastapi[standard]\"), it includes a package called fastapi-cli, this package provides the fastapi command in the terminal.\n\nTo run your FastAPI app for development, you can use the fastapi dev command:\n\nThe command line program called fastapi is FastAPI CLI.\n\nFastAPI CLI takes the path to your Python program (e.g. main.py) and automatically detects the FastAPI instance (commonly named app), determines the correct import process, and then serves it.\n\nFor production you would use fastapi run instead. 🚀\n\nInternally, FastAPI CLI uses Uvicorn, a high-performance, production-ready, ASGI server. 😎\n\nRunning fastapi dev initiates development mode.\n\nBy default, auto-reload is enabled, automatically reloading the server when you make changes to your code. This is resource-intensive and could be less stable than when it's disabled. You should only use it for development. It also listens on the IP address 127.0.0.1, which is the IP for your machine to communicate with itself alone (localhost).\n\nExecuting fastapi run starts FastAPI in production mode by default.\n\nBy default, auto-reload is disabled. It also listens on the IP address 0.0.0.0, which means all the available IP addresses, this way it will be publicly accessible to anyone that can communicate with the machine. This is how you would normally run it in production, for example, in a container.\n\nIn most cases you would (and should) have a \"termination proxy\" handling HTTPS for you on top, this will depend on how you deploy your application, your provider might do this for you, or you might need to set it up yourself.\n\nYou can learn more about it in the deployment documentation.",
