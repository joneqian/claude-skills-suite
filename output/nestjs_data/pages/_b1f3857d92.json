  "content": "In this set of articles, you'll learn the core fundamentals of Nest. To get familiar with the essential building blocks of Nest applications, we'll build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.\n\nWe're in love with TypeScript, but above all - we love Node.js. That's why Nest is compatible with both TypeScript and pure JavaScript. Nest takes advantage of the latest language features, so to use it with vanilla JavaScript we need a Babel compiler.\n\nWe'll mostly use TypeScript in the examples we provide, but you can always switch the code snippets to vanilla JavaScript syntax (simply click to toggle the language button in the upper right hand corner of each snippet).\n\nPlease make sure that Node.js (version >= 20) is installed on your operating system.\n\nSetting up a new project is quite simple with the Nest CLI. With npm installed, you can create a new Nest project with the following commands in your OS terminal:\n\nThe project-name directory will be created, node modules and a few other boilerplate files will be installed, and a src/ directory will be created and populated with several core files.\n\nHere's a brief overview of those core files:\n\nThe main.ts includes an async function, which will bootstrap our application:\n\nTo create a Nest application instance, we use the core NestFactory class. NestFactory exposes a few static methods that allow creating an application instance. The create() method returns an application object, which fulfills the INestApplication interface. This object provides a set of methods which are described in the coming chapters. In the main.ts example above, we simply start up our HTTP listener, which lets the application await inbound HTTP requests.\n\nNote that a project scaffolded with the Nest CLI creates an initial project structure that encourages developers to follow the convention of keeping each module in its own dedicated directory.\n\nLearn the right way! 80+ chapters 5+ hours of videos Official certificate Deep-dive sessions Explore official courses\n\nNest aims to be a platform-agnostic framework. Platform independence makes it possible to create reusable logical parts that developers can take advantage of across several different types of applications. Technically, Nest is able to work with any Node HTTP framework once an adapter is created. There are two HTTP platforms supported out-of-the-box: express and fastify. You can choose the one that best suits your needs.\n\nWhichever platform is used, it exposes its own application interface. These are seen respectively as NestExpressApplication and NestFastifyApplication.\n\nWhen you pass a type to the NestFactory.create() method, as in the example below, the app object will have methods available exclusively for that specific platform. Note, however, you don't need to specify a type unless you actually want to access the underlying platform API.\n\nOnce the installation process is complete, you can run the following command at your OS command prompt to start the application listening for inbound HTTP requests:\n\nThis command starts the app with the HTTP server listening on the port defined in the src/main.ts file. Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. You should see the Hello World! message.\n\nTo watch for changes in your files, you can run the following command to start the application:\n\nThis command will watch your files, automatically recompiling and reloading the server.\n\nCLI provides best effort to scaffold a reliable development workflow at scale. Thus, a generated Nest project comes with both a code linter and formatter preinstalled (respectively eslint and prettier).\n\nTo ensure maximum stability and extensibility, we use the base eslint and prettier cli packages. This setup allows neat IDE integration with official extensions by design.\n\nFor headless environments where an IDE is not relevant (Continuous Integration, Git hooks, etc.) a Nest project comes with ready-to-use npm scripts.",
