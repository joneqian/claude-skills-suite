  "content": "This tutorial shows you how to use FastAPI with most of its features, step by step.\n\nEach section gradually builds on the previous ones, but it's structured to separate topics, so that you can go directly to any specific one to solve your specific API needs.\n\nIt is also built to work as a future reference so you can come back and see exactly what you need.\n\nAll the code blocks can be copied and used directly (they are actually tested Python files).\n\nTo run any of the examples, copy the code to a file main.py, and start fastapi dev with:\n\nIt is HIGHLY encouraged that you write or copy the code, edit it and run it locally.\n\nUsing it in your editor is what really shows you the benefits of FastAPI, seeing how little code you have to write, all the type checks, autocompletion, etc.\n\nThe first step is to install FastAPI.\n\nMake sure you create a virtual environment, activate it, and then install FastAPI:\n\nWhen you install with pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" it comes with some default optional standard dependencies, including fastapi-cloud-cli, which allows you to deploy to FastAPI Cloud.\n\nIf you don't want to have those optional dependencies, you can instead install pip install fastapi.\n\nIf you want to install the standard dependencies but without the fastapi-cloud-cli, you can install with pip install \"fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]\".\n\nThere is also an Advanced User Guide that you can read later after this Tutorial - User guide.\n\nThe Advanced User Guide builds on this one, uses the same concepts, and teaches you some extra features.\n\nBut you should first read the Tutorial - User Guide (what you are reading right now).\n\nIt's designed so that you can build a complete application with just the Tutorial - User Guide, and then extend it in different ways, depending on your needs, using some of the additional ideas from the Advanced User Guide.",
