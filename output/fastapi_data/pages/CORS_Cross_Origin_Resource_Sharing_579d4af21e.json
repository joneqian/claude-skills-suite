  "title": "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)¶",
  "content": "CORS or \"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\" refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different \"origin\" than the frontend.\n\nAn origin is the combination of protocol (http, https), domain (myapp.com, localhost, localhost.tiangolo.com), and port (80, 443, 8080).\n\nSo, all these are different origins:\n\nEven if they are all in localhost, they use different protocols or ports, so, they are different \"origins\".\n\nSo, let's say you have a frontend running in your browser at http://localhost:8080, and its JavaScript is trying to communicate with a backend running at http://localhost (because we don't specify a port, the browser will assume the default port 80).\n\nThen, the browser will send an HTTP OPTIONS request to the :80-backend, and if the backend sends the appropriate headers authorizing the communication from this different origin (http://localhost:8080) then the :8080-browser will let the JavaScript in the frontend send its request to the :80-backend.\n\nTo achieve this, the :80-backend must have a list of \"allowed origins\".\n\nIn this case, the list would have to include http://localhost:8080 for the :8080-frontend to work correctly.\n\nIt's also possible to declare the list as \"*\" (a \"wildcard\") to say that all are allowed.\n\nBut that will only allow certain types of communication, excluding everything that involves credentials: Cookies, Authorization headers like those used with Bearer Tokens, etc.\n\nSo, for everything to work correctly, it's better to specify explicitly the allowed origins.\n\nYou can configure it in your FastAPI application using the CORSMiddleware.\n\nYou can also specify whether your backend allows:\n\nThe default parameters used by the CORSMiddleware implementation are restrictive by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable particular origins, methods, or headers, in order for browsers to be permitted to use them in a Cross-Domain context.\n\nThe following arguments are supported:\n\nallow_credentials - Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to False.\n\nNone of allow_origins, allow_methods and allow_headers can be set to ['*'] if allow_credentials is set to True. All of them must be explicitly specified.\n\nexpose_headers - Indicate any response headers that should be made accessible to the browser. Defaults to [].\n\nThe middleware responds to two particular types of HTTP request...\n\nThese are any OPTIONS request with Origin and Access-Control-Request-Method headers.\n\nIn this case the middleware will intercept the incoming request and respond with appropriate CORS headers, and either a 200 or 400 response for informational purposes.\n\nAny request with an Origin header. In this case the middleware will pass the request through as normal, but will include appropriate CORS headers on the response.\n\nFor more info about CORS, check the Mozilla CORS documentation.\n\nYou could also use from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware.\n\nFastAPI provides several middlewares in fastapi.middleware just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available middlewares come directly from Starlette.",
