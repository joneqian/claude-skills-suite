  "content": "In short, use fastapi run to serve your FastAPI application:\n\nThat would work for most of the cases. 😎\n\nYou could use that command for example to start your FastAPI app in a container, in a server, etc.\n\nLet's go a little deeper into the details.\n\nFastAPI uses a standard for building Python web frameworks and servers called ASGI. FastAPI is an ASGI web framework.\n\nThe main thing you need to run a FastAPI application (or any other ASGI application) in a remote server machine is an ASGI server program like Uvicorn, this is the one that comes by default in the fastapi command.\n\nThere are several alternatives, including:\n\nThere's a small detail about names to keep in mind. 💡\n\nThe word \"server\" is commonly used to refer to both the remote/cloud computer (the physical or virtual machine) and also the program that is running on that machine (e.g. Uvicorn).\n\nJust keep in mind that when you read \"server\" in general, it could refer to one of those two things.\n\nWhen referring to the remote machine, it's common to call it server, but also machine, VM (virtual machine), node. Those all refer to some type of remote machine, normally running Linux, where you run programs.\n\nWhen you install FastAPI, it comes with a production server, Uvicorn, and you can start it with the fastapi run command.\n\nBut you can also install an ASGI server manually.\n\nMake sure you create a virtual environment, activate it, and then you can install the server application.\n\nFor example, to install Uvicorn:\n\nA similar process would apply to any other ASGI server program.\n\nBy adding the standard, Uvicorn will install and use some recommended extra dependencies.\n\nThat including uvloop, the high-performance drop-in replacement for asyncio, that provides the big concurrency performance boost.\n\nWhen you install FastAPI with something like pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" you already get uvicorn[standard] as well.\n\nIf you installed an ASGI server manually, you would normally need to pass an import string in a special format for it to import your FastAPI application:\n\nThe command uvicorn main:app refers to:\n\nEach alternative ASGI server program would have a similar command, you can read more in their respective documentation.\n\nUvicorn and other servers support a --reload option that is useful during development.\n\nThe --reload option consumes much more resources, is more unstable, etc.\n\nIt helps a lot during development, but you shouldn't use it in production.\n\nThese examples run the server program (e.g Uvicorn), starting a single process, listening on all the IPs (0.0.0.0) on a predefined port (e.g. 80).\n\nThis is the basic idea. But you will probably want to take care of some additional things, like:\n\nI'll tell you more about each of these concepts, how to think about them, and some concrete examples with strategies to handle them in the next chapters. 🚀",
