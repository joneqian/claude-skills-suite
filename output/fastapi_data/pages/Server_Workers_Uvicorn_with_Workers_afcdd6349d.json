  "content": "Let's check back those deployment concepts from before:\n\nUp to this point, with all the tutorials in the docs, you have probably been running a server program, for example, using the fastapi command, that runs Uvicorn, running a single process.\n\nWhen deploying applications you will probably want to have some replication of processes to take advantage of multiple cores and to be able to handle more requests.\n\nAs you saw in the previous chapter about Deployment Concepts, there are multiple strategies you can use.\n\nHere I'll show you how to use Uvicorn with worker processes using the fastapi command or the uvicorn command directly.\n\nIf you are using containers, for example with Docker or Kubernetes, I'll tell you more about that in the next chapter: FastAPI in Containers - Docker.\n\nIn particular, when running on Kubernetes you will probably not want to use workers and instead run a single Uvicorn process per container, but I'll tell you about it later in that chapter.\n\nYou can start multiple workers with the --workers command line option:\n\nIf you use the fastapi command:\n\nIf you prefer to use the uvicorn command directly:\n\nThe only new option here is --workers telling Uvicorn to start 4 worker processes.\n\nYou can also see that it shows the PID of each process, 27365 for the parent process (this is the process manager) and one for each worker process: 27368, 27369, 27370, and 27367.\n\nHere you saw how to use multiple workers to parallelize the execution of the application, take advantage of multiple cores in the CPU, and be able to serve more requests.\n\nFrom the list of deployment concepts from above, using workers would mainly help with the replication part, and a little bit with the restarts, but you still need to take care of the others:\n\nIn the next chapter about FastAPI in Containers - Docker I'll explain some strategies you could use to handle the other deployment concepts.\n\nI'll show you how to build your own image from scratch to run a single Uvicorn process. It is a simple process and is probably what you would want to do when using a distributed container management system like Kubernetes.\n\nYou can use multiple worker processes with the --workers CLI option with the fastapi or uvicorn commands to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, to run multiple processes in parallel.\n\nYou could use these tools and ideas if you are setting up your own deployment system while taking care of the other deployment concepts yourself.\n\nCheck out the next chapter to learn about FastAPI with containers (e.g. Docker and Kubernetes). You will see that those tools have simple ways to solve the other deployment concepts as well. ✨",
