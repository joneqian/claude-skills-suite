  "content": "FastAPI gives you the following:\n\nInteractive API documentation and exploration web user interfaces. As the framework is based on OpenAPI, there are multiple options, 2 included by default.\n\nIt's all based on standard Python type declarations (thanks to Pydantic). No new syntax to learn. Just standard modern Python.\n\nIf you need a 2 minute refresher of how to use Python types (even if you don't use FastAPI), check the short tutorial: Python Types.\n\nYou write standard Python with types:\n\nThat can then be used like:\n\n**second_user_data means:\n\nPass the keys and values of the second_user_data dict directly as key-value arguments, equivalent to: User(id=4, name=\"Mary\", joined=\"2018-11-30\")\n\nAll the framework was designed to be easy and intuitive to use, all the decisions were tested on multiple editors even before starting development, to ensure the best development experience.\n\nIn the Python developer surveys, it's clear that one of the most used features is \"autocompletion\".\n\nThe whole FastAPI framework is based to satisfy that. Autocompletion works everywhere.\n\nYou will rarely need to come back to the docs.\n\nHere's how your editor might help you:\n\nYou will get completion in code you might even consider impossible before. As for example, the price key inside a JSON body (that could have been nested) that comes from a request.\n\nNo more typing the wrong key names, coming back and forth between docs, or scrolling up and down to find if you finally used username or user_name.\n\nIt has sensible defaults for everything, with optional configurations everywhere. All the parameters can be fine-tuned to do what you need and to define the API you need.\n\nBut by default, it all \"just works\".\n\nValidation for most (or all?) Python data types, including:\n\nValidation for more exotic types, like:\n\nAll the validation is handled by the well-established and robust Pydantic.\n\nSecurity and authentication integrated. Without any compromise with databases or data models.\n\nAll the security schemes defined in OpenAPI, including:\n\nPlus all the security features from Starlette (including session cookies).\n\nAll built as reusable tools and components that are easy to integrate with your systems, data stores, relational and NoSQL databases, etc.\n\nFastAPI includes an extremely easy to use, but extremely powerful Dependency Injection system.\n\nOr in other way, no need for them, import and use the code you need.\n\nAny integration is designed to be so simple to use (with dependencies) that you can create a \"plug-in\" for your application in 2 lines of code using the same structure and syntax used for your path operations.\n\nFastAPI is fully compatible with (and based on) Starlette. So, any additional Starlette code you have, will also work.\n\nFastAPI is actually a sub-class of Starlette. So, if you already know or use Starlette, most of the functionality will work the same way.\n\nWith FastAPI you get all of Starlette's features (as FastAPI is just Starlette on steroids):\n\nFastAPI is fully compatible with (and based on) Pydantic. So, any additional Pydantic code you have, will also work.\n\nIncluding external libraries also based on Pydantic, as ORMs, ODMs for databases.\n\nThis also means that in many cases you can pass the same object you get from a request directly to the database, as everything is validated automatically.\n\nThe same applies the other way around, in many cases you can just pass the object you get from the database directly to the client.\n\nWith FastAPI you get all of Pydantic's features (as FastAPI is based on Pydantic for all the data handling):",
