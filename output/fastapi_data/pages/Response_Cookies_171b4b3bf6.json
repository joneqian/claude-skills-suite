  "content": "You can declare a parameter of type Response in your path operation function.\n\nAnd then you can set cookies in that temporal response object.\n\nAnd then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a dict, a database model, etc).\n\nAnd if you declared a response_model, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.\n\nFastAPI will use that temporal response to extract the cookies (also headers and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any response_model.\n\nYou can also declare the Response parameter in dependencies, and set cookies (and headers) in them.\n\nYou can also create cookies when returning a Response directly in your code.\n\nTo do that, you can create a response as described in Return a Response Directly.\n\nThen set Cookies in it, and then return it:\n\nKeep in mind that if you return a response directly instead of using the Response parameter, FastAPI will return it directly.\n\nSo, you will have to make sure your data is of the correct type. E.g. it is compatible with JSON, if you are returning a JSONResponse.\n\nAnd also that you are not sending any data that should have been filtered by a response_model.\n\nYou could also use from starlette.responses import Response or from starlette.responses import JSONResponse.\n\nFastAPI provides the same starlette.responses as fastapi.responses just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.\n\nAnd as the Response can be used frequently to set headers and cookies, FastAPI also provides it at fastapi.Response.\n\nTo see all the available parameters and options, check the documentation in Starlette.",
